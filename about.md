## About

The Dis-orientation Collective has not been able to get in touch with a dis-orientation group from University of California - Santa Cruz. However, we are currently [hosting some of their previous dis-orientation guides](http://ucsc.dis-orientation.info).

If you are from UC - Santa Cruz and are interested in getting involved with the Dis-orientation collective, [please get in touch with us](http://dis-orientation.info/contact/).
